An about Keith Morgan website for prospective interviews, clients, and more!

This website will consist of basic HTML, CSS and possibly a teeny bit of Javascript. This is my Final Project for my HTML class, so it'll likely change quite often as I learn more.
There will be working navigation links, images with correct src links, as well as some basic CSS animation.
